			<p class='subhead'><strong>Lady Skollie has a reputation for using her art to directly call out public figures who have been accused or imprisoned for rape.</span>
</strong></p>

			<p>Breaking taboos through paintings and digital media&mdash;including Twitter and a sex talk radio show, by addressing issues of gender, sex, pleasure, and abuse&mdash;Johannesburg-based Lady Skollie is <span class="masked">colonizing</span> London with her first solo UK exhibition, Lust Politics at Tyburn Gallery. Lady Skollie, born Laura Windvogel, tells The Creator&#8217;s Project that making <span class="masked">art</span> tackling these issues is &#8216;sometimes a bit tricky&#8217; in South Africa, a country which is alleged to have among the highest rates of rape and sexual violence in the world. &#8216;We have things like the &#8216;bro code,&#8217; molestation, rape&mdash;all of these things happen and men aren&#8217;t held accountable,&#8217; she says. &#8216;I think accountability is key for people to heal and for people to feel <span class="masked">heard</span> and understood.&#8217;</p>

			<p>Taking accountability into her own hands, Lady Skollie has a reputation for <span class="masked">using</span> her art to directly call out public figures who have been accused or imprisoned for rape. This includes a piece in honor of <span class="masked">Khwezi</span>, the <span class="masked">woman</span> who accused South African President Jacob Zuma of rape&mdash;an offense he was charged for before the case was dismissed the following year. Lady Skollie also made an artwork about South African rapper Okmalumkoolkat, which she <span class="masked">tells</span> us got a huge, largely negative response. She says, &#8216;Everyone came at me and asked &#8216;Why don&#8217;t you just let it go, he made a mistake.&#8217; That is crazy, letting all of it go. We&#8217;re always expected to just &#8216;Let it go.&#8217; &#8217;</p>

			<p>But what can we expect from Lust Politics? Like her online personality, Lady Skollie&#8217;s exhibition is <span class="masked">loud</span> and proud, using vibrant colors to depict powerful women. The paintings in Lust Politics use fruit such as <span class="masked">bananas</span> and papayas, depicting the artist&#8217;s discontent with unrealistic sexual standards and the objectification of women&#8217;s bodies. The women vary in appearance, some are green and others have body parts made of fruit. According to Lady Skollie, this is her <span class="masked">homage</span> to Khoisan imagery, which &#8216;plays into my own identity as a colored woman. It also plays into self-hate that really is a killer within colored identity, because we do not have self-love.&#8217;</p>

<p>The name &#8216;Skollie&#8217; comes from an Afrikaans word used to describe a <span class="masked">shady</span> character who deliberately breaks the rules and normally refers to a person of color. The artist&#8217;s racial identity is <span class="masked">central</span> to her work, something which affected her growing up in a predominantly white Afrikaner school in Cape Town. &#8216;Men would see colored women as <span class="masked">objects</span> and fetishize you,&#8217; she explains, an issue tackled in her earlier work Sometimes reluctantly I reflect on all the times I let my pussy to be colonised.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s this fusion of confrontational gender critique and her own sensitive, personal story which makes Lady Skollie&#8217;s work so powerful. But while it&#8217;s clear the artist&#8217;s work has an <span class="masked">activist</span> slant, Lady Skollie says she&#8217;s &#8216;not under any misconceptions that I&#8217;m going to change the world because I&#8217;m painting paw paws [papayas].&#8217; Nevertheless, the artist&#8217;s <span class="masked">finger-up</span> to the patriarchy amidst the &#8216;bro code&#8217; culture <span class="masked">adopted</span> by men in South Africa (and beyond) is undoubtedly brave&mdash;and whether people agree with her or not, she is definitely being heard. Lady Skollie explains that she is excited when she gets <span class="masked">messages</span> from women saying that her work has given them power to &#8216;confront people or not be quiet for the sake of a man&#8217;s comfort.&#8217; She continues, &#8216;It is time for people to feel uncomfortable, and for people to ask themselves very hard questions about how they <span class="masked">relate</span> to women, how they treat them, how they talk to them.&#8217;</p>

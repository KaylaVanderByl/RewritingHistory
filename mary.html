			<p class='subhead'><strong>Mary Sibande re-imagines the story of South Africa&#8217;s domestic workers.</strong></p>


			<p>South African artist Mary Sibande&#8217;s avatar Sophie&mdash;a human-scale sculpture modeled on herself&mdash;was <span class="masked">born</span> during her final year at the University of Johannesburg fine arts degree.</p>

			<p>Sibande, whose older female relatives had been domestic workers, was <span class="masked">assigned</span> by one of her professors to tell a <span class="masked">story</span> through her artwork. &#8216;I remember talking to my supervisor and saying, &#8216;I want to play detective and investigate why these women in my <span class="masked">family</span> were all domestic workers.&#8217; I wanted to pay homage to them,&#8217; said Sibande.</p>

			<p>Since graduating&mdash;with honors&mdash;in 2007, the artist, who is now 37 years old, has developed many larger-than-life sculptural variations of Sophie, all <span class="masked">based</span> on Sibande&#8217;s body and cast in fiberglass and silicon.</p>
<P>Sibande&#8217;s work not only engages as an interrogator of the current intersections of race, <span class="masked">gender</span> and labour in South Africa; but continues to actively rewrite her own family&#8217;s legacy of <span class="masked">forced</span> domestic work imposed by the then Apartheid State. Sibande employs the <span class="masked">human</span> form as a vehicle through photography and sculpture as a focused critique on the stereotypical depictions of women, particularly black women in South Africa. The <span class="masked">body</span>, for Sibande, and particularly how we clothe it, is the site where this history is contested and where Sibande&#8217;s own fantasies can play out.</P>

<p>Growing up in a small rural town in eastern South Africa, Sibande, whose work has been collected by institutions including the Smithsonian in Washington, and Zeitz MOCAA, in Cape Town, initially wanted to become a fashion designer.</p>
<p>This first aspiration is apparent in her work, which <span class="masked">shows</span> Sophie often draped in flowing fabrics. &#8216;I wanted to bring her to the foreground, hence these big dresses that fill the whole space,&#8217; she said.</p>
<p>Sophie, whose <span class="masked">eyes</span> are always closed to indicate she is dreaming with elaborate scenarios where she can be anything, has appeared dressed up as everything, from a lady holding a parasol (&#8216;I&#8217;m a Lady&#8217; 2009), an African queen with an elaborate beadwork necklace (&#8216;Her Majesty Queen Sophie&#8217; 2010) to a conductor with an imaginary wand (&#8216;Silent Symphony&#8217; 2010) and a soldier in fatigues (&#8216;Living Memory&#8217; 2011).</p>
<p>Over the years, Sophie&#8217;s representations have become more mature, illustrating the artist&#8217;s thoughts around Apartheid, the fall of the regime and issues surrounding modern day South Africa.</p>
<p>Sibande's striking use of color <span class="masked">plays</span> an important role in getting her message across. Sophie is usually lavishly dressed and displayed against backgrounds that are executed using a dominant, symbolic color.</p>
<p>For Sibande&#8217;s first <span class="masked">solo</span> show at a professional gallery&mdash;&#8216;Long Live the Dead Queen&#8217; at Johannesburg&#8217;s Gallery MOMO in 2009&mdash;she introduced Sophie as a representation of Sibande&#8217;s great-grandmother wearing a long cape inspired by Queen Victoria&#8217;s coronation outfit in 1838. &#8216;I like the term &#8216;royal blue&#8217; (turning) these domestic workers into royalty,&#8217; she said.</p>
<p>Both Sibande&#8217;s mother and grandmother are <span class="masked">proud</span> of her artistic career, and her grandmother loves to show articles and reviews of Sibande&#8217;s work to friends. &#8216;I collected a lot of stories form her,&#8217; Sibande said. &#8216;And I remember one day she said to me &#8216;this is amazing what you are doing, taking this <span class="masked">ugly</span> history and making it into these beautiful objects.&#8217; &#8217;</p>
<p>Four years after her first solo show, Sibande transitioned Sophie into purple, a color that has <span class="masked">symbolic</span> connotations of nobility, luxury and <span class="masked">power</span>. It is also the color that gave name to the &#8216;Purple Rain&#8217; 1989 anti-Apartheid <span class="masked">protest</span>, in Cape Town, where police marked demonstrators with purple <span class="masked">dye</span> sprayed from water cannons.</p>
<p>&#8216;At that time, I wanted to <span class="masked">talk</span> about me, I wanted to see where am I am among these women, where do I see myself,&#8217; said Sibande. &#8216;These women worked so hard to put me in the forefront, to put me in a place that they wanted to be in, but they couldn&#8217;t, and here I am living their dream.&#8217;</p>
<p>Sibande, whose first UK solo show &#8216;I Came Apart at the Seams&#8217; is now on display at London&#8217;s Somerset House, is two years into her red stage, a color that she feels helps tell the <span class="masked">story</span> of the legacy of Apartheid. &#8216;I am kind of playing psychologist,&#8217; she said, adding that she is <span class="masked">working</span> on a large sculpture for Art Basel Miami, entitled &#8216;Domba Dance,&#8217; featuring Sophie feeding exhausted red hell hounds a heart.</p>
<p>&#8216;I want to know why South Africans are angry, why they live the way they live.&#8217;</p>

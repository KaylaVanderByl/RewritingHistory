			<p class='subhead'><strong>The Life-saving Work of Anna &#8216;Sister Nannie&#8217; Tempo, the Christian missionary who dedicated her life to helping the <span class="masked">downtrodden</span>, especially women prostitutes in Cape Town.</span>
</strong></p>


			<p>Anna &#8216;Sister Nannie&#8217; Tempo, was born of a <span class="masked">slave</span> mother and father who were kidnapped as children off the coast of Mozambique. She was born in the late 1870s and grew up in Worcester. One day in 1884, a Christian lady by the name of Miss Schreiner, who later became Mrs Stakeby-Lewis, asked Anna&#8217;s mother if she could take her daughter into her service, and her mother agreed. Early in her career with Miss Schreiner, Anna <span class="masked">struggled</span> to feel convinced by the Christian faith, but was soon brought around by an <span class="masked">incident</span> in which she recovered from being gravely sick, and attributed this convalescence to the <span class="masked">power</span> of a higher being.</p>

			<p>For the rest of her life, Sister Nannie, as she came to be known, assisted Miss Schreiner in her work <span class="masked">running</span> Christian workshops under the banner of the Gospel Temperance. These workshops had a missionising purpose, and also aimed to <span class="masked">steer</span> members of the Worcester community away from the temptations of <span class="masked">alcohol</span>. Indeed, Nannie&#8217;s own father, a certain William Tempo, one day stumbled into a Gospel Temperance meeting and was saved from his destructive alcoholism with which his daughter was only too familiar. Following the success of these meetings, Miss Schreiner expanded the <span class="masked">enterprise</span> to include the rest of the Western Cape, and took Nannie along with her.</p>

			<p>In 1888, Miss Schreiner went even further afield, to Australia, England, and the United States, again taking Nannie with her. Upon returning from these travels, Miss Schreiner and her charge settled in Cape Town. Shortly afterwards Miss Schreiner dies and Nannie spent a period in <span class="masked">Ireland</span> working as a nurse to the family of a colonel. In 1914 Nannie returned to Cape Town to continue the work begun by her matron and benefactor. However, Nannie <span class="masked">redirected</span> her energies into what she called &#8216;<span class="masked">rescue</span> work.&#8217; She would go out alone each night after midnight into <span class="masked">brothels</span> and down to the docks looking for prostitutes to convert and save from the dangers of the streets. Not long passed before Nannie was receiving donations so that she was able to establish a formal &#8216;Rescue House.&#8217; This soon became an institution recognised by the Cape Town City Council and police. In 1937 Sister Nannie was <span class="masked">honoured</span> with the bestowal of one of King George's Coronation Medals in recognition of the work she had been doing in Cape Town.</p>

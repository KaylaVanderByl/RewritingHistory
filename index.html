        <h3>Eva Krotoa</h3>
        <h4>Source: South African History Online</h4>
          <p>Krotoa (known as Eva to the Dutch and English settlers) was the niece of Autshumao, a Khoi leader and interpreter to the Dutch (he was known as Harry/Herry first by the English and then by the Dutch).</p>

<p>A young Krotoa, of about 10 or 11 years old, was taken in by Jan van Riebeeck during the first few days of Dutch settlement in the Cape. She worked as a servant to the Commander’s wife, Maria van Riebeek (nee de la Quellerie), and is first mentioned in van Riebeeck’s diary in January 1654 as ‘a girl who had lived with us’. She mastered Dutch and Portuguese and responded eagerly to Christian instruction given her by Maria.</p>

<p>As her command of the Dutch language and her familiarity with Dutch ways grew, so did her usefulness as an interpreter. Krotoa established herself as a staunch friend of the Dutch, negotiating a co-operative relationship between the fort and the followers of her rich relative Oedasoa. She was later instrumental in working out terms for ending the First Dutch-Khoi-khoi War.</p>

<p>In the 1650s Eva was the only figure possessing an intimate knowledge of both Khoikhoi and Dutch culture; as she passed back and forth between one society and the other, she exchanged her Dutch clothing for Khoikhoi skins, and vice versa. However, her work as an interpreter was not easy at this time, as she was torn between her loyalty to the Dutch (who had taken her in and given her new clothes) and her own people (whose land was being taken over by the Dutch in the late 1650s). Due to this dilemma, Krotoa often struggled to maintain trust on both sides.</p>

    <h4>Source: South African History Online</h4>
      <p>Anna de Koning was to make quite a name for herself at the Cape, moving from being a slave to becoming the owner of the great Cape property, Groot Constantia.</p>
      <p>It is believed that Anna was born in bondage somewhere around 1656 in Batavia, meaning she was very young when she arrived at the Cape. She is the only slave from the time of whom there is a portrait.</p>
      <p>Anna, who had been born a slave, died in 1734, a wealthy widow of a prestigious Cape gentleman and the owner of one of the greatest properties of the Cape. As the mother of 12 children Anna, like her mother, is one of the stammoeders of South African society and many South Africans, of all colours and creeds,
        and in particular all of the Bergh family, can trace their lineage back to her.</p>

  <h3 id='baartman'>Sarah Baartman</h3>
  <h4>Source: BBC News Magazine, Author: Justin Parkinson</h4>
    <p>Sarah Baartman's life was one of huge hardship. It is thought she was born in South Africa's Eastern Cape in 1789, her mother died when she was two and her father, a cattle driver, died when she was an adolescent. She entered domestic service in Cape Town after a Dutch colonist murdered her partner, with whom she had had a baby who died.
In October 1810, although illiterate, Baartman allegedly signed a contract with English ship surgeon William Dunlop and mixed-race entrepreneur Hendrik Cesars, in whose household she worked, saying she would travel to England to take part in shows.
The reason was that Baartman, also known as Sara or Saartjie, had what was called "steatopygia," resulting in extremely protuberant buttocks due to a build-up of fat.
These made her a cause of fascination when she was exhibited at a venue in London's Piccadilly Circus after her arrival.
On stage she wore skin-tight, flesh-coloured clothing, as well as beads and feathers, and smoked a pipe. Wealthy customers could pay for private demonstrations in their homes, with their guests allowed to touch her. Baartman's promoters nicknamed her the "Hottentot Venus", with "hottentot" - now seen as derogatory - then being used in Dutch to describe the Khoikhoi and San, who together make up the peoples known as the Khoisan.<p>
  <p>Sarah Baartman died on 29 December 1815, but her exhibition continued.
Her brain, skeleton and sexual organs remained on display in a Paris museum until 1974. Her remains weren't repatriated and buried until 2002.Today she is seen by many as the epitome of colonial exploitation and racism, of the ridicule and commodification of black people.

<h3>Charlotte Maxeke</h3>
<h4>Source: Black Past, Author: Racquel West</h4>
  <p>Charlotte Maxeke was a South African woman who broke societal barriers throughout her life. She was born in South Africa on April 7, 1874 and in the early 1880s attended secondary school at Edwards Memorial School. Maxeke was offered a scholarship to attend the university, Wilberforce, where she studied with a number of scholars including W.E.B. DuBois. She geared her college experience toward preparing for missionary work once she returned to South Africa.
In the early 1900s, Maxeke returned to South Africa and is now recognized as the first black South African woman to have a college degree, as she graduated from Wilberforce with bachelors of science degree. She began teaching in Pietersburg (now Polokwane), while simultaneously working on opening the first AME college in South Africa. Maxeke and her husband founded a primary and secondary school called “Wilberforce Institute” in Evaton, South Africa.</p>
<p>Throughout her life, Maxeke worked to create opportunities and equality for women in South Africa. She participated in a variety of organizations, including the Joint Councils of Europeans and Bantus and helped establish the Widow’s Home and the Foreign Missionary Society. Additionally, she vouched for Hastings Walter Kazumu Banda who led Malawi’s independence campaign and who in 1966 became the country’s first President, helping him receive a passport to attend Wilberforce University on scholarship.</p>

<h3>Anna Tempo</h3>
<h4>Source: Women Marching Into the 21st Century (book)</h4>
  <p>Anna Tempo, a well-known social worker, was born in Worce ter in 1867. At the tirne of her birth her father was a freed slave who worked at a vineyard, while her mother did washing and ironing. As a young girl, in about 1884, Tempo worked for Henrietta Schreiner (later
Stakesby Lewis), caring for her orphaned nephew. The children nicknamed Tempo 'Nannie.' With this family she visited Australia, England and the United States of America (USA) before settling in Cape Town.</p>
Tempo assisted Schreiner, a well-known temperance worker with welfare work among black people. This work had a great influence on her. She visited the homes of coloureds, women's wards in prisons and hospitals and prostitutes in the Cape Town docks. In 1912 after Schreiner died, Tempo served as a nurse in Ireland. In 1914 she returned to Cape Town and became matron of the newly opened
Stakesby Lewis hotels and continued her work among stranded, destitute and homeless women, trying to find permanent shelter for them. Financial support of the Dutch Reformed Church and the Dutch Reformed Mission Church later made it possib[e to have a home built for these women, called Nannie House and to set up health clinics. The Child Life Protection Society, maternity homes and the police sent women and girls over there. In 1937 Tempo received the King George Coronation Medal in recognition of her work among Cape Town prostitutes. She died in Nannie House in 1946. In terms of the Group Areas Act, Nannie House was moved from Cape Town to Athlone in October 1960. </p>

<h4>Source: South Africa Venues, Cissie Gool Memorial</h4>
  <p>Zainunnisa 'Cissie' Gool was the only woman to serve on Cape Town's City Council at a time when she did not have the right to vote, representing District Six between 1938 and 1951. She was said to be a woman way ahead of her time, and was known as Cape Town's Joan of Arc.</p>
  <p>Cissie Gool belonged to a group of politically aware individuals known as the new 'radicals' of Cape Town, who went on to form their own political party - the National Liberation League (NLL).

She subsequently led a breakaway faction becoming its first president, supporting the idea of a 'United Working-Class Front'. The main thrust of her politics was a new order of black unity and working-class alliances. She actively rejected any engagement with sympathetic white politicians.

And then she ran for a seat on the City Council, first in 1937 and then again the following year, when she won Ward7, including District Six. In 1962, after receiving an LLB degree at UCT, she was the first woman of colour called to the Cape Bar.</p>

<h3>Frances Baard</h3>
<h4>Source: The Presidency, Republic of South Africa</h4>
  <p>Frances Baard was born in 1901 in Kimberley, Northern Cape. Before she became an educator, Baard worked as a domestic worker. She saw the injustice and became part of men and women who fought for South Africa to be free from oppression. She was supported and influenced by Raymond Mhlaba and Ray Alexander.

Baard was an effective organiser during the 1952 Defiance Campaign. She was part of the ANC Women’s League (ANCWL). She was appointed as secretary and treasurer of the ANCWL’s Port Elizabeth branch. Later on Baard became the national treasurer of the ANCWL and on the executive committee of the Federation of South African Women in the mid-1950s.</p>

<p>Baard was part of the drafting of the Freedom Charter in 1955 and also was one of the demonstrators who played a leading role in the Women’s march to the Union Buildings on 9 August 1956, to protest against the pass laws. She was a defendant in the Treason Trial and became a member of the executive committee of the South African Congress of Trade Unions. Baard’s activism landed her in jail for 12 months in solitary confinement in 1963. This did not deter her from the struggle. Very soon after her release from solitary confinement, Baard was sentenced to five years imprisonment for ANC activities and in terms of the Suppression of Communism Act in 1964.</p>

  <p>In 1950, angered by new influx control regulations in Port Elizabeth, she led a demonstration that ended in the burning of permits. She was one of the first women volunteers in the 1952 Defiance Campaign, and spent six weeks in prison for civil disobedience. She was later tried with the Cape leaders of the campaign and given a nine month suspended sentence.

In the mid-1950s, Matomela was the Cape provincial organiser of the African National Congress (ANC) Women’s League and vice-president of the Federation of South African Women. She was among the original 156 defendants in the Rivonia Treason Trial, but charges against her were later withdrawn. She was banned and restricted to Port Elizabeth in 1962 and was subsequently given a five-year sentence for furthering the aims of the banned ANC.</p>

<p>While she was in prison, her health deteriorated badly, as she was sometimes deprived of much-needed medical attention, such as the insulin injections for her diabetes. Soon after her release, Matomela was banned again, and died under banning orders in 1969.</p>

<h3>Lilian Ngoyi</h3>
<h4>Source: Encyclopedia.com</h4>
  <p>Lillian Ngoyi (born 1911) was known as "the mother of the black resistance" in South Africa. She served as president of the women's league of the African National Congress. The South African government declared her a "banned person" in the mid-1960s. This meant that her movements and contacts were restricted and she could not be quoted in the press. Ngoyi lived under the banning order for 16 years.</p>
<p>Ngoyi joined the African National Congress (ANC) in 1952. This organization was dedicated to ending the unequal status of black and white South Africans, known as apartheid. Ngoyi, along with political pioneers Helen Suzman, Helen Joseph, Ida Mtwana and Charlotte Mxeke founded the Women's League of the ANC. She eventually attained leadership positions, among them national president and Transvaal provincial president of the Women's League. In 1953, Ngoyi was imprisoned for playing a role in a Congress campaign against race laws. A year later, she became the only woman elected to the National Executive of the African National Congress. In 1955, Ngoyi served as an elected delegate to the World Mothers' Conference in Lausanne, Switzerland. She had left South Africa without a passport in order to attend the event. A year later, she was named the national president of the newly formed, Federation of South African Women. Ngoyi led 20,000 women in August 1956 to protest the inclusion of women in the pass laws controlling the movements of blacks. The group held their protest at the Union Building offices of the prime minister, J.G. Strijdom. Ngoyi was arrested and tried for treason, but was later acquitted.

<h3>Albertina Sisulu</h3>
<h4>Source: Encyclopedia Britannica</h4>
  <p>Albertina Sisulu, (Nontsikelelo Thethiwe), South African political activist (born Oct. 21, 1918, Camama, Cape Province [now in Eastern Cape province],—died June 2, 2011, Johannesburg, S.Af.), was a revered figure in the struggle against South Africa’s apartheid system as the wife of African National Congress (ANC) leader Walter Sisulu and in her own right, especially during his long imprisonment (1964–89) on charges of plotting to overthrow the government. She grew up in South Africa’s Transkei region and attended Christian missionary schools, where she acquired the name Albertina. She met Sisulu in 1941 while she was training as a nurse in Johannesburg; they were married in 1944. Ma (or Mama) Sisulu, as she came to be called, was a prominent member of the ANC Women’s League, the Federation of South African Women, and the antiapartheid United Democratic Front, and she participated in the historic Aug. 9, 1956, march by some 20,000 black women protesting South Africa’s racist pass laws. During her husband’s incarceration, she also endured periods in which she was detained, banned, or placed under house arrest. After his release and the country’s move to multiracial democracy, she was elected (1994) to a four-year term in the parliament.

<h3>Rahima Moosa</h3>
<h4>Source: South African History Online</h4>
  <p>As a teenager, Rahima Moosa and her identical twin sister, Fatima became politically active after they became aware of the unjust segregationist laws that ruled South Africa. In 1943 Rahima became the shop steward for the Cape Town Food and Canning Workers’ Union. She later became the branch secretary for the union and more active in labour politics.
In Johannesburg, Rahima became involved with the Transvaal Indian Congress and thereafter the African National Congress as the Congress and the ANC had signed a pact for a common struggle. In 1955 she played a significant role in the organisation of the Congress of the People, where the Freedom Charter was adopted. In 1956, she helped organise the Women’s March, under the auspices of the Federation of South African Women (FEDSAW). Together with Helen Joseph, Lillian Ngoyi and Sophia Williams, Rahima spearheaded the historic march to the Union Buildings where women handed over petitions against pass laws. Rahima and her twin sister Fatima always managed to confuse the security branch officer as they could easily switch identities, in times of harassment.</p>
<p>In the early 1960s, Rahima became listed, a status that she remained in until 1990 with the unbanning of the African National Congress. In 1970 she suffered a heart attack, as a result of diabetes and after this her health detoriated drastically until her death in 1993, a year before independence. Before passing away, she made it a point that her children would continue her work for a just South African Society, her children have since been active in the ANC and her husband, though old is also active in political work.</p>

She was one of the most visible and outspoken opponents of South Africa's apartheid regime from the 1960s till its dismantling in the early 1990s. She was also the anti-apartheid movement's most audible spokesperson, having entered the top flight of international performers and able to sell out prestigious concert halls with a repertoire that changed little over three decades of musical evolution.</p>

<p>Makeba's career propelled her from township singing group to global celebrity, feted in some countries and banned from others. She was a natural and consummate performer with a dynamic vocal range and an emotional awareness that could induce the delusion of intimate contact in even the most impersonal auditorium.</p>

<h3 id ='winnie'>Winnie Madikizela-Mandela</h3>
<h4>Source: BBC News and The New York Times</h4>
  <p>Winnie Madikizela-Mandela's resistance to harassment and championing of the anti-apartheid cause led to periods of imprisonment from 1969, much of it spent in solitary confinement.
In 1976, the year of the Soweto riots, she was banished from the township to a remote rural area. At one stage her house was burned down, with suspicion falling on the South African security forces.
This led to her being dubbed the "Mother of the Nation".
By the mid-1980s and the start of a long period of township militancy against the white government of President P W Botha, she was back in Soweto and at the heart of the struggle.</p>
<p>Charming, intelligent, complex, fiery and eloquent, Ms. Madikizela-Mandela (Madikizela was her surname at birth) was inevitably known to most of the world through her marriage to the revered Mr. Mandela. It was a bond that endured ambiguously: She derived a vaunted status from their shared struggle, yet she chafed at being defined by him. Ms. Madikizela-Mandela commanded a natural constituency of her own among South Africa’s poor and dispossessed, and the post-apartheid leaders who followed Mr. Mandela could never ignore her appeal to a broad segment of society. In April 2016, the government of President Jacob G. Zuma gave Ms. Madikizela-Mandela one of the country’s highest honors: the Order of Luthuli, given, in part, for contributions to the struggle for democracy.

Ms. Madikizela-Mandela retained a political presence as a member of Parliament, representing the dominant African National Congress, and she insisted on a kind of primacy in Mr. Mandela’s life, no matter their estrangement.</p>

  <p>The only surviving leader of the 1956 march, Sophia Williams-de Bruyn - then barely 18, together with Lilian Ngoyi, Rehana Moosa and Helen Joseph - led 20 000 women in protest against the infamous pass laws. Even before the march Williams-de Bruyn had been a champion of the cause of equality for women.

Today, as deputy speaker of the Gauteng legislature, she continues her struggle to work for the betterment of the community. In recognition of her work, she was appointed commissioner on the Commission for Gender Equality.</p>

<p>Williams-de Bruyn was born in 1938 in Port Elizabeth. Her introduction to unions started when, as a young girl, she worked at a textile factory to earn pocket money. She never returned to school and instead continued working at the factory where she later became a shop steward. She became an executive member of the Textile Workers' Union in Port Elizabeth, working alongside people like Raymond Mhlaba, Vuyisile Mini and Govan Mbeki.

She was a founder member of the SA Congress of Trade Unions. Because of her interactions with the political movements of the day, she was appointed full-time organiser of the Coloured People's Congress in 1955.</p>

<p>Born in 1964 in the small village of Langa, Cape Town, Fassie came from a musical family and began singing early, forming her first singing group at the age of four. Her precocious talent brought her to the attention of talent scouts from Johannesburg, one of whom eventually took the young teenager to the city to kick-start her career. After singing background vocals for other artists, Fassie broke out with the group Brenda & the Big Dudes with whom she recorded her biggest hit in 1986's "Weekend Special." She went on to a solo career soon after and working with producer Sello "Chicco" Twala Fassie had continued success at the end of the '80s with the hits "Too Late for Mama" and the controversial "Black President," which was banned in apartheid-era South Africa.</p>

  <p>South African photographer and filmmaker Zanele Muholi was born in 1972 in Umlazi, South Africa. Muholi self-identifies as a visual activist, and their development as a photographer is deeply intertwined with their advocacy on behalf of the LGBTQ community in South Africa and beyond. After Muholi cofounded the Forum for the Empowerment of Women (FEW) in 2002, they enrolled at the Market Photo Workshop in Newtown, South Africa, established by the photographer David Goldblatt in 1989. In 2009 Muholi earned an MFA in documentary media from Ryerson University, Toronto.</p>
<p>Muholi has produced a number of photographic series investigating the severe disconnect that exists in post-apartheid South Africa between the equality promoted by its 1996 Constitution and the ongoing bigotry toward and violent acts targeting individuals within the LGBTQ community. As an ensemble, Muholi’s images display the depth and diversity of this group in South Africa and in various countries that the artist has visited. With a profound commitment to redressing the social injustices faced by LGBTQ people, Muholi embraces a subjective perspective in their practice by forming relationships with the individuals they depict, including the women in Only Half the Picture (2003–06), the transgender or gay men in Beulahs (2006–10), and the couples in Being (2007).</p>

  <p>In her video/installation work The Eclipse Will Not be Visible to the Naked Eye (2009), Bopape attempts to reconnect with her conservative South African hometown Polokwane after years of studying abroad. She films herself returning to Polokwane in a bright red dress that contrasts jarringly with her surroundings; viewers watch the video play amid an installation full of objects that suggest the trappings of suburban domesticity. Increasingly focusing her practice on time-based mediums, Bopape has in recent years explored virtual space in order to question, as she says, “If there is space within the virtual, how deep does it go? How far can a sound or an image recede?” Her more recent video works often comprise surreal mashups of both abstract and representational imagery—flowers and seascapes—combined with animation, found footage, and sounds.

<h3>Mary Sibande</h3>
<h4>Source: Kavi Gupta Gallery</h4>
  <p>Mary Sibande is an artist who lives and works in Johannesburg. Her work not only engages as an interrogator of the current intersections of race, gender and labour in South Africa; but continues to actively rewrite her own family’s legacy of forced domestic work imposed by the then Apartheid State. Sibande employs the human form as a vehicle through photography and sculpture as a focused critique on the stereotypical depictions of women, particularly black women in South Africa. The body, for Sibande, and particularly how we clothe it, is the site where this history is contested and where Sibande’s own fantasies can play out.</p>

<p>This counter history takes the form of an alter-ego in Sibande’s early work, a persona by the name of ‘Sophie’ who is dressed in various uniforms that resemble the dresses worn by domestic workers. Altering these dress styles into Victorian motifs, Sibande completely reanimates Sophie’s history through how her body is adorned and the way she occupies these narratives that were stolen and denied from her. This is not just a political act, but one of transformation, as Sophie takes on new incarnations of herself unbound from the laboured history of servitude; as it relates to the present in terms of domestic relationships. Transitioning from blue to purple to red, Sibande introduces us not only to the many faces of herself and
‘Sophie,’ but to the complex person hoods of African Women who continue to create worlds and narratives outside of the canon of Western Imperialism.</p>

<h3>Lady Skollie</h3>
<h4>Source: 100 Women by Okay Africa</h4>
  <p>Lady Skollie, born Laura Windvogel in Cape Town, South Africa, is an artist now based in Johannesburg. While her paintings look playful on the surface with bright colors and uniquely posed subjects, given more time, they reveal themselves as riveting masterpieces.</p>

<p>Starting at a young age, Windvogel was trained in more traditional art forms—first studying at Frank Joubert Art Centre in Cape Town. In 2009, she received her BA of History and Art in Dutch Literature, and a Certificate in Business Acumen for Artists from the University of Cape Town Graduate School of Business in 2014.</p>

<p>Working under her artistic name, Lady Skollie—Skollie being a derogatory term in Afrikaans—Windvogel has created a body of work that’s unabashedly feminist and raunchy and full of humor. In her work she fights against gender-based violence in South Africa by using crayons, watercolor, and ink to draw symbolic fruits, and “fiery vaginas” in powerful evocative scenes.</p>

<p>In just one painting, Lady Skollie encapsulates the themes of human sexuality, masculinity, violence, pleasure, abuse and consent. She has created various artworks that have been exhibited all over South Africa, and in galleries and fairs in other parts of the world. Some of her exhibits include Lust Politics, at Tyburn Gallery in London, UK, and Mating Dance at the AKAA Art Fair in Paris, France. Having already been featured on CNN International, African Voices, and BBC Africa, Lady Skollie is here to show women that they can rise above their greatest obstacles, and look fly while doing so.</p>

<h4>Source: New Statesman</h4>
  <p>Caster Semenya is a South African middle-distance runner and 2016 Olympic gold medalist. She became world 800m champion at 18.

Rather than adulation and sponsorship deals, her victory led to a ban, invasive medical examinations and a flurry of media reports that she had both male and female sexual characteristics.

Semenya unintentionally instigated an international and often ill-tempered debate on gender politics, feminism and race, becoming an inspiration to gender campaigners around the world.</p>

<h4>Source: The New York Times</h4>
  <p>Madjozi is a new kind of global pop star; she pays homage to her heritage while updating it for the moment, cutting across continents and genres.

Born in a village in Limpopo Province, north of Johannesburg, Madjozi’s formative years were mostly spent outside South Africa: Her father worked for an international development nonprofit, and his work took the family to Dar es Salaam, Tanzania. After high school, Madjozi attended college in Massachusetts.

This globe-trotting youth exposed her to cultural influences from around Africa and the world. Yet it’s the Tsonga heritage of her birthplace that she is best known for celebrating.The Tsonga are a distinct ethnic group with their own language and culture, and many Tsonga people in South Africa arrived as refugees from Mozambique in the 19th century, Madjozi said. They faced discrimination and xenophobia that still persists, she said.

Being Tsonga “wasn’t cool,” Madjozi said, and she wanted to change that. One of her signature looks involves a “xibelani” skirt, which is worn by Tsonga women for dancing.</p>

<h4>Source: People.com</h4>
  <p>History was made when South African native Zozibini Tunzi was crowned Miss Universe on Sunday night.
For the first time in the pageant world’s history, all four major titles — Miss America, Miss USA, Miss Teen USA and now Miss Universe — are held by black women.</p>
<p>In her answer during the pageant, Tunzi touched on the misconception of women being unfit for leadership. She similarly hopes that her new role as Miss Universe helps break down other stereotypes.
“Just by being on that stage and representing women who look like me… and not just women who look like me, but women who have felt that they’ve been misrepresented or haven’t seen a different kind of beauty,” Miss Universe told Good Morning America, “[I’m] hoping to change that narrative and say look, women are multifaceted, we’re not all the same and we shouldn’t be boxed into one type of beauty.”</p>

<h3>Tony Gum</h3>
<h4>Source: Fountainhead Residency, Artists</h4>
  <p>Tony Gum is a South African artist and photographer. Her often minimalist yet considered approach to story telling, translated onto canvas, has to date informed her distinctive evolutionary journey. Also central to her growth, the grace and alchemy experienced in her work which, immediately connects one to her artistry. A self-reflective artist, Gum offers considered perspectives to the meta-narratives of an ever-changing world.</p>
<p>Tony Gum’s exhibitions are by nature a dual and deeply engaging experience. In the first instance, it is an intimate still life, human encounter with the artist. Her arresting spirit captured as photographic canvas means, the viewer gaze lingers as though in conversation with the artist herself.  A second aspect of the experience with Tony’s work is the story and narrative explored. Each aspect replies on and is, seamlessly woven into another. Her physical form and photography extended as methods of instruction, relaying the stories and personal perspectives of her world.</p>
